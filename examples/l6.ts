/**
 * **Ladder L6 — the gate.** Eight real runs on a real scheduler, and P1's exit
 * artifact.
 *
 * ```
 *   npm run test:l6         node examples/l6.ts
 *   npm run test:l6:deno    deno run --import-map=examples/deno-import-map.json ... examples/l6.ts
 * ```
 *
 * **Every expected value below was written from the spec before anything ran**,
 * and each is derivable without a scheduler:
 *
 *   - the run-state outcome from `spec/run-state.md` section 3's precedence;
 *   - which policy fires from
 *     [ADR 0003](../doc/decisions/0003-a-join-is-satisfied-when-its-region-has-no-live-branches.md)'s
 *     matrix, whose eighteen cells were themselves hand-derived from
 *     `spec/join-policy.md` sections 2-4;
 *   - the dispatched task ids from `spec/task-id.md`'s four-segment scheme and
 *     the flow's own node ids.
 *
 * A value taken from output is a snapshot rather than a test
 * (`doc/workflow.md` section 5 rule 2), and the rendered table at the bottom is a
 * **by-product** of the same values the assertions use — never their source.
 *
 * ## What each row is for
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | `fanout-join` x both | the control. Both policies must agree, or the comparison has no baseline — ADR 0003's `all-arrive` row |
 * | `p1-routed-away` at **high** confidence x both | the predicate returns **false**, both branches arrive, both policies fire. Without this row `isLowConfidence` is an assertion that cannot fail |
 * | `p1-routed-away` at **low** confidence x both | **P1's case, on real workers.** `live-token` completes; `arrival-count` hangs, and run state now says `stuck` rather than `completed` ([ADR 0015](../doc/decisions/0015-a-run-whose-join-can-no-longer-fire-is-stuck.md)) |
 * | `optional-loss` x both | **ADR 0003's second mechanism, and the ordinary one.** No decision and no routing away — an `optional` task simply fails and its branch is LOST. `live-token` still fires the join; `arrival-count` is `stuck` anyway. It is also the only row where a task settles as anything but `done`, which is what makes the terminal-state assertions able to fail |
